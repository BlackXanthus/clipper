## Contributing

I didn't provide a license because I really don't care what you do with this. If you want to steal it, modify it, and use it in your enterprise application, go right ahead. I don't even care if you copy the repo and say you made it. I just use this program for myself.

### Submitting PRs

Make sure you submit PRs against `develop` and not `master`.
